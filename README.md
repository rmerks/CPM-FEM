# CPM-FEM

This is a version of the CPM-FEM code introduced in Van Oers, Rens et al. P Comput Biol 2014, [doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003774](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003774) with Qt visualization. The Qt visualization replaces the Matlab visualization in the original code.

## Usage:
First compile:
`qmake`
`make`

Run:
`./cpmfem Network/`

## Further information
Biological, mathematical and implementation details are available in the accompanying paper (see above) and in its supplements.
